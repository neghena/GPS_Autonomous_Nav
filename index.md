# GPS Autonomous Navigation

## An exploration into autonomous navigation with a GPS

### Background 

Our team’s project in the context of our domain is to build an autonomous GPS-based navigation system that will be robust and reliable enough to be competitive in a race. The challenge in doing so primarily comes down to understanding the shortcomings of the GPS being used so that its problems can be mitigated through supplementary methods. In addition to the differences in accuracy between GPS products at different price points, GPS’s in general tend to suffer from issues of signal interference which lead to delays in positioning updates and lack of precision as well as oscillating data even when left at a fixed position. To build a navigation system for a vehicle that will travel at high speeds, it is crucial that vehicle positioning is provided accurately and quickly. The hurdle for our project, then, is to create a reliable navigation system using GPS that can update instantaneously and precisely despite these being the characteristic issues that plague the GPS.

### GPS Comparisons: u-blox NEO-M8N vs ZED-F9P

NEO-M8N Performance            |  ZED-F9P Performance
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![neo](Images/neo_m8n_cep_2drms.png)  |  ![zed](Images/zed_f9p_park_cep_2drms.png)

- For the ZED-F9P, CEP is 0.097 meters and the 2DRMS is 0.233 meters.
- For the NEO-M8N, CEP is 1.532 meters and the 2DRMS: 3.710 meters.

From these results, we can see that the ZED-F9P performs significantly better then the NEO-M8N. Thus we chose this GPS for the purposes of developing an autonomously navigating vehicle! 

### GPS & IMU Sensor Fusion
 
We fused together our GPS with an IMU using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

The red arrows are the raw IMU and odometry data that we embedded
some noise into its y-axis. The blue arrow is EKF-filtered odometry 
and IMU data. As you can see, the EKF is able to reduce the noise and 
provide a more accurate position of the vehicle.

Our simulated tests of the vehicle proved to be successful! Over the course of a full lap around the UCSD Warren track, the EKF algorithm was able to reduce the error in localization error essentially down to zero. 

### Waypoint Selection and Navigation

** maybe some flow charts & explanations ***
![buff](Images/BUFFER_RADIUS_DIAGRAM.png)

We set a buffer radius for each waypoint we want to go to so that we don't "miss" a waypoint & make incorrect navigation choices just because noisy data.

We use a lookahead point to determine if we've reached our current waypoint.
